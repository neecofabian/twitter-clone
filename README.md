# twitter-clone
A foundation for the backend of a Twitter clone.

This was my first time creating a web app and working with a database, so I mainly used online resources and tutorials. It is unfinished but a good start.
To make user-related features extensible in the future, I separated routes from the functions they provide as seen in [```routes/users.js```](https://github.com/neecofabian/twitter-clone/blob/master/routes/users.js) and [```controllers/users.js```](https://github.com/neecofabian/twitter-clone/blob/master/controllers/users.js). Usage examples are in [```request.rest```](https://github.com/neecofabian/twitter-clone/blob/master/request.rest).

## Running
```npm i``` to install dependencies and ```npm start``` to run.

## Other Repos
Here are some past projects Iâ€™ve worked on, such as my [personal website](https://neecofabian.com) on [GitHub](https://github.com/neecofabian/neecofabian.github.io) which I finished recently.

Also, this is [Conference Manager](https://github.com/neecofabian/Conference-Manager), a program to organize large-scale tech conferences which I made with 7 other students. My biggest contributions in it are features related to the management of events and venues by different user roles.
